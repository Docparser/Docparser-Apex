## About

This repository provides Apex code snippets which you can use to integrate your Salesforce installation with Docparser. The code snippets are organised in individual files and correspond to the the Docparser API routes.

All code snippets were contributed for free by our generous Docparser users. Further contributions are more than welcome!

For a generic description of the Docparser API, please see our developer documentation [here](https://dev.docparser.com/). Our developer documentation lists all available API methods with their parameters and expected responses.

Docparser also offer a direct [Salesforce integration](https://docparser.com/integration/salesforce) which can be used to create new Salesforce objects from parsed document data without any coding.

## Code

At the time of writing, two API routes are available as Apex code snippets. The two snippets allow you to perform the following actions:

* [Upload a document](upload_document.apx) from Salesforce to Docparser
* [Get the parsed data](get_parsed_document_data.apx) of a previously imported document
